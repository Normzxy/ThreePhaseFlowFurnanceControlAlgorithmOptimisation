On the basis of this project, I received an engineering degree, from the Silesian University of Technology. The subject of the project is a custom approach to the control of a flow furnace, consisting of three heaters, powered by a single phase. All the necessary information about the work can be found in the file named "Engineering Thesis", which is a comprehensive description of the entire project, including tests carried out on the thermal installation, available at the Silesian University of Technology. The thesis was written in Polish language. The processed data used in the thesis is located in the Files folder. The "zap17" file can be opened in TIA Portal V17 and it contains all the logic of the program created in LAD and SCL languages.
